# Week 1.2, Session 1: Task 4

fruit = {"apple", "orange", "tomato"}
vegetables = {"leek", "tomato", "potato"}

# What do you think will be printed here?

both = fruit.intersection(vegetables)
print(both)             #prints "tomato"


# Why does the following code diplay five items?

food = fruit.union(vegetables)
print(food)             #prints all fruits and vegetables

# Add an item to fruit

fruit.add("banana")
print(fruit)

# Remove an item from vegetables

vegetables.discard("potato")
print(vegetables)

# Find and display symmetric difference of the two sets

print(fruit.symmetric_difference(vegetables))
